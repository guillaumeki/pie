# Commit Policy
Date: 2026-02-03

We use Conventional Commits for important changes.

## Format
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

## Types
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation
- refactor: code change without behavior change
- test: tests only
- chore: tooling/maintenance

## Guidelines
- Use imperative mood in the summary.
- Keep the summary short and specific.
- Add a body when context is needed.
- Use "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the footer for breaking changes.
