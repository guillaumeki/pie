## Development Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Quality Checks
Run the quality checks described in `AGENTS.md` (mypy, tests, ruff, coverage, bandit, pip-audit, vulture, radon).

## Process
- Important changes require a plan and design doc.
- Update documentation after design docs so it stays current.
- Build docs locally with `mkdocs build --clean` before push.
- Documentation examples must be executable and covered by unit tests.

## Notes
See `AGENTS.md` for the full change process and templates.
